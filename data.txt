A poll published in The Guardian reveals that Winnie-the-Pooh is the UK's favourite childhood book character, just pipping Harry Potter.
1,200 people who read at least once a week were quizzed.
George, Enid Blyton¡¯s tomboy adventurer from the Famous Five, was third with The Hobbit¡¯s Bilbo Baggins and Roald Dahl¡¯s Matilda in fourth and fifth places.
The survey was commissioned by the Reading Agency, which has launched a Summer Reading Challenge for children in libraries across the country.
